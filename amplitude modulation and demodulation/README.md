## About the Experiment :<br>

---

_This experiment aims to clearly show the user how the amplitude modulation and demodulation is done.And why do we need Amplitude modulation._<br>

---

## <B>Objective:</B>

---

_1. To Simulate virtually and Interpret Amplitude Modulation and De modulation waveforms_

_2. To Demonstrate Critical, Under and Over modulated AM waveforms_

---

## <b>Purpose:</b>

---

_The basic knowledge of communication engineering starts with Amplitude Modulation. Interpreting AM and its waveform will simplify the understanding of other analog and digital modulation techniques._

## <b>Target Group:</b>

---

_Pre final year Students of Communication Engineering and faculty teaching engineering_

## <b>1. Virtualization</b>

### <b>1. How do you intend to virtualize the experiments?</b>

- _AM modulation and De-Modulation is the basic communication Experiment._
- _The understanding of the experiment lies in the interpretation of the waveforms generated._
- _So the importance is given for generating the AM waveforms which includes the message signal, carrier signal and modulated waveform._
- _The user has to input the values of message signal and carrier signal frequency in Hz and amplitude in volts which in turn produce related waveforms._
- _Three degrees of modulation (Critical, Over and Under) can also be visualized through the experiment._
- _The modulated signal is fed to the demodulator circuit and output demodulated signal which is equivalent to the input signal is observed._

### <b>2. How will the student get a feel for a real lab?</b>

- _Students will have the access of lab equipments virtually and can interpret and practice, become familiar and confident with the equipments before doing the real labs._
- _Students can set the various values and infer the changes in the waveform which will further give them a feel for a real lab._

### <b>3. Will you be using animations?</b>

- _Yes we will be using animations while visualizing the different waveforms._

### <b> Technologies Used</b>

**1. Software to be used for Web interface:**

_Hyper Text Mark up Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),Canvas and Java Script_

**2. Software to be used for back-end**

## <b> Documentation</b>

---

### <b>Online manual:</B>

---

_Theory and Manual of the experiment will be provided in separate tab of the experiments before Simulation tab so that it improves the interpreting of the experiment of the students._

---

### <b> Theory of Amplitude Modulation:</b>

---

_Modulation is defined as the process by which some characteristics of a carrier signal is varied in accordance with a modulating signal. The base band signal is referred to as the modulating signal and the output of the modulation process is called as the modulation signal._

---

### <b>Step by step procedure:</b>

---

_The Step by step procedure will added after the theory tab and before the simulation tab of the experiment. The sample procedure is given below:_

- The carrier signal frequency and amplitude to be set
- The modulating signal frequency and amplitude to be set
- The amplitude of the modulated waveform should be noted.
- By varying the amplitude of modulating signal corresponding maximum (Vmax) and minimum (Vmin) amplitude of the modulated signal is noted
- The practical modulation index is calculated using the following formula.

m a = (Vmax - Vmin ) / (Vmax + Vmin )

- Based on the modulation Index degrees of modulation can be interpreted.

## <b> Quiz for self-evaluation:</b>

Pre test and Post test based on multiple choice questions will be given to evaluate the understanding of the students.

Sample questions are given below:

- What is Modulation?

- What is Need for Modulation?

- What is Amplitude Modulation?

- Define Modulation Index
