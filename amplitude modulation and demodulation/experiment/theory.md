## <b> INTRODUCTION</b> <br>

### Amplitude modulation is a technique used in communication, most commonly for transmitting messages with a radio carrier wave.

### In amplitude modulation, the amplitude of the carrier wave is varied with accordance to that of the message signal.

## <b>CONCEPT</b><br>

### Modulation is the process in which  characteristics of a high frequency carrier signal is varied in accordance with a messange signal.The output of the modulation process is called as the modulated signal.

<b>Under Modulation</b> <br>

### If the modulation Index value is less than 1,then the modulated output would look like the following figure.

<b>Over Modulation</b> <br>

### If the value of the modulation index is greater than 1,then the wave will be an over-modulated wave.<br><br>
