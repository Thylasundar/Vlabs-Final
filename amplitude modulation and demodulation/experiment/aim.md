**Aim:**
### To Virtually Simulate and Interpret Amplitude Modulation and De-modulation.
___
**Purpose:**
### Amplitude Modulation is the basic knowledge where communication engineering starts. Interpreting AM and its waveform will simplify the understanding of other analog and digital modulation techniques.
___
**Objective:**
+ To make the user clearly understand all abput Amplitude Modulation and De modulation waveforms

+ To Demonstrate Critical, Under and Over modulated AM waveforms
